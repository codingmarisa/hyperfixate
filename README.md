## Tell me about it

Hyperfixate is a blog site built with Next.js (v13) that uses the Notion API to create a simplified publishing method. While Next.js tackles the technical logistics of building and running the site, the Notion API adds a simple way to compose and submit blog posts from any smart device with an internet connection.

## Credits

This project was inspired by [My Notion Blog](https://notion-blog.vercel.app). However, this code was written by myself, independent of the original inspiration.
